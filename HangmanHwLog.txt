Hangman Error Log

Start time: 08.30

1. In Constructor, Group needed to create allLetters, usedLetters, secretWord, and knownSoFar as String Buffers. They also needed to use .append() method for knownSoFar. I changed them so that they did that.
2. Hangman class needed essential comments, such as //properties.
3. Secret Word Chooser's comments should be separated into two lines. 
4. Most groups codes' were not indented properly. There were other whitespace errors. 
5. Hangman class was written with properties that have the word list as an ArrayList. Secret Word Chooser uses String array. I changed the properties such that it used a String array for Secret Word chooser word list.
6. Some names in Secret Word Chooser were too long, such as randomNumberForChoosingAWord. I changed that to randomNo.
7. Piece 3a has no comments and explanations for what is happening in the code. I chose 3b because it is more thorough. 3B had some whitespace problems as well.
8. Piece 3b has no parameter type in formal parameter. I added the parameter type “char.”
9. I removed piece01 from package to make compiling easier. Because of the package, there were some errors in compiling.
10. I renamed piece01 file as Hang and piece05 file as Hangman because class Hang and Hangman is public, so should be declared in a file named Hang.java and Hangman.java
11. Hangman class method getNumOfIncorrectTries() and main method getnumberOfIncorrectTries()) did not have the same name. I changed the one in the main method to getNumOfIncorrectTries().
12. I made chooseSecretWord a method by removing it from class it was in (chooseSecretWord class).
13. In tryThis 03bpiece, following error was given: Error: char cannot be dereferenced. This is because char is a primitive type and so methods cannot be called from it. I simply removed the statement to make it uppercased. 
14. The code has successfully compiled.
15. More whitespace errors in main method were fixed
16. Tested the code, IT WORKS!
17. Hang.java and Hangman.java were put in single project HangmanHW.java
18. Some Print statements were added to main method to make it more user friendly.

End time: 09.51


Overall Comments: Generally, there were no major errors when putting the code together. It was mostly that each piece had subtle differences in naming certain things, like methods. I fixed mostly comments and made the code more organized. To improve this mistake, I think that the groups can communicate with each other to use common names and whether to use array/ arrayList, as well. Other than that, combining the pieces were no problem at all.
